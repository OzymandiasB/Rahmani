##Technical Background
I am a fairly well rounded programmer. I have experience writing in C++, Java, Python, R, Lisp, HolyC, and SQL. I prefer to do more research related programming rather than developing games, because I find game development really frustrating. My specialty is Artificial Intelligence, but I also enjoy delving in other areas. Recently I have been into computational biology.
